<h1>My test</h1>
This is a test.
<u>This line is underlined.</u>
<u>This line is underlined in a different way.</u>
<b>This line is bold.</b>
<invert>This line is inverted.</invert>
<flip>This line is flipped.</flip>

Here is a line with <u>underlined text that is long enough to wrap</u> but then the underline stops partway through the line. Wow!

<h1>THE END</h1>

That is the end. Thank you very much for testing!
